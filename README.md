# CCInteractionLibrary
The Interaction Library from ConsoleCommander

Just pulled it from the game, and replaced a method that would break it, if the rest of the game wasn't there.
Give it a look, haven't tested it, so it might require some debugging if trying to get it to run, but the critical files should all be there.
